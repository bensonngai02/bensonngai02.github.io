For thanksgiving break this year, I wanted to take a short weekend trip before heading home to Texas without adding too much travel time. This easily narrowed it down to one of the states between California and Texas:
- Arizona
- Colorado
- Nevada
- New Mexico
- Utah

I had already visited Nevada and Utah earlier this summer as part of a post-grad senior tripe with my roommates, so those were out of the list. I wanted something nature-filled and a bit more wintery-feeling heading into December, so Colorado it was. I'm aiming to visit Arizona sometime in the summer or fall (Grand Canyon, Petrified Forest), and New Mexico I don't have too many plans for just yet. 

This wasn't my first time going to Colorado. I had first visited on a last-minute tag-along ski trip to Vail with a friend in high school,

then a summer road trip with my family where we drove all around Colorado and visited so many sights (Rocky Mountains, Black Canyon of the Gunnison Rock, Great Sand Dunes),

and then finally a trip to Colorado Springs for a college club tennis tournament just over two years ago.

There's a reason I keep going back to Colorado; as of now, it definitely ranks as **one of my top five favorite states**. Besides Washington, I believe Colorado has one of *the best* nature scenes in America. The national parks are jaw-dropping, and even some state parks could be considered national parks in any other state. I feel like at such an altitude, even the air smells fresher there the moment I step out of the airport. With only a few days time, I didn't want to venture out too far from Denver, where I was flying in. Being just a short 45 minute drive away from DEN, Boulder was the ideal location for a weekend itinerary. Plus, I had never been. 

## Day 1
The first night in Boulder was spent going to [Pearl Street Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sMBj2MyhTdGQpCsU6 "buzz"), one of the main sites to see in downtown Boulder. Essentially, its a pedestrian mall that spans a few blocks with a bunch of shops and restaurants, including a pretty cool [bookstore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Di84QPEgQH8YRfv6 "buzz") that we walked into. The bookstore had a whole basement and second floor with the most variety and genres of books I had seen in a while, and it had a really cool and cozy vibe. I didn't take any photos in the bookstore itself, but here are some random pics from the mall.

Walking around the mall wasn't really the main attraction I had planned, though. Instead, earlier in the week, I found a restaurant with stellar reviews (rarely do you ever see a 4.9 on Google Maps) called [Cozobi Fonda Fina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bUUp3KmpVZcvtvBJ7 "buzz"), which was located in the mall. As an avid foodie, a core part of research I always do before going on trips is scouting out all the great food and restaurants the destination has to offer. I had previously seen an Instagram reel on Cozobi's sister restaurant, [Alma Fonda Fina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qvwdLY5XG6XkBMNM6 "buzz"), and really wanted to go in Denver but was fully booked out till January 2026. Yes, you heard that right, it was booked out for a full month out. Nevertheless, the menu looked like it had really inventive and non-traditional dishes, and that's almost always enough for me to get amped up about trying a new restaurant. I'll leave the details of [our experience at Cozobi in a separate post here](./cozobi-fonda-fina "buzz"), but let's just say it was one of the best meals I've had in 2025.

## Day 2
We headed to [Chautauqua Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bAt8bTvcEVm3dkuZ7 "buzz"), which is probably one of the main reasons people go to Boulder. It's shockingly close to the downtown Boulder, and has stunning mountain scenario and an abundance of trails. Its primarily known for the [Flatirons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flatirons "buzz"), which are these massive slab-like mountains. If I went to CU Boulder, I feel like I would've come here every single weekend. 

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/chautauqua-1.webp "size=xl")

Initially, since I had rolled my ankle slightly a few days earlier, we had found a not-too-tough moderate trail on AllTrails ([Bluebell, Woods Quarry, Enchanted Mesa Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/bluebell-trail-woods-quarry-trail-and-enchanted-mesa?sh=tr4suv&utm_medium=trail_share&utm_source=alltrails_virality "buzz"), which we had planned to do. Since the entrance trail across most of the trails was the same, we just decided to wing it and follow the path. Slowly did we realize we had taken a wrong turn at fork near the beginning of the trail, since the trail started getting *pretty steep*. I honestly thought I was just out of shape, as I was sweating a good amount thought the trail was certainly classified as a "Hard". Little did we know, we were actually on the [First and Second Flatirons Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/first-and-second-flatiron-loop?sh=tr4suv&utm_medium=trail_share&utm_source=alltrails_virality "buzz") when we saw this insane view. 

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/chautauqua-2.webp "size=l") ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/chautauqua-3.webp "size=s")

We continued hiking towards the second flatirons, where we eventually saw this guy doing some sort of paragliding but in a canoe-like thing. He was just doing circles over the park and looked like he was having the time of his life. Honestly, we had no idea how he even got up there in the first place. We were also originally going to visit the [Royal Arch](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/royal-arch-trail?sh=tr4suv&utm_medium=trail_share&utm_source=alltrails_virality "buzz") as well, but decided to leave instead in interest of time to see other sites.

Next, we went to the another trail/park area nearby called the [Lost Gulch Overlook](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JCgy4bSPLNsLxTSL7 "buzz"), which was a high viewpoint to see a bunch of mountains and all of Boulder as well. This one was much easier to get to though; we simply just drove up this winding rode and the trailhead was just a few minutes from the actual overlook itself. 

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/lost-gulch-1.webp) ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/lost-gulch-2.webp)

The overlook itself was actually fairly packed with families and people; a couple was doing their engagement photoshoot right on the edge of the rocks, another was doing some type of video interview recording, and there were just a bunch of kids running and climbing around. It was all quite random. The views were pretty amazing. I remember thinking what it would be like growing up in Boulder; maybe this was a common hangout place for high schoolers. Who knows.

Starving after our active day of hiking and craving Chinese food, we decided to head to [Nana's Dim Sum & Dumplings](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wPkYyDnLXQBEudcG9 "buzz"), which was inconveniently located right next to CU Boulder's campus, making parking a bit difficult as it was a football gameday. The area reminded me of [The Drag / Guad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BACatZpbgf1WsiYF8 "buzz") back at UT with a bunch of restaurants and college bars. Similarly, we also had a Chinese restaurant (China Family) right outside campus. 

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/restaurants/nanas-boulder/nanas-1.webp "size=s")![Picture](/assets/blog/restaurants/nanas-boulder/nanas-2.webp "size=s") ![Picture](/assets/blog/restaurants/nanas-boulder/nanas-3.webp "size=s")

From left to right, we had a Chongqing-chicken style inspired dish (not exactly authentic but tasty nevertheless), red chili oil dumplings, and "Thumblet" bao dumplings. Taking me by surprise, the thumblets were my favorite dish of the night. They had a crisp on the bottom of the bun but burst with soup and meat, and I couldn't stop eating them. I would come back just for these little singular bites of deliciousness.  
## Day 3
At this point, we felt like we had done most of the major stuff in Boulder. Though I had visited Rocky Mountain National Park a few years ago, it was a short hour drive away, and it was a no-brainer for us to go as I had bought the national park annual pass earlier this year and wanted to maximize its use. Having a bit of a lazy morning, we got some [bagels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7E3dgpYeXbcAdjWDA "buzz") and coffee, and started driving up to the Rockies at around noon. 

The Rockies were gorgeous and very charming this time of year. The last time I had come was in July/August, and the scenery was extremely green and fresh. I would still recommend someone to go to the Rockies during the summer for their very first time. This time around, since it was a bit colder, there were *much* fewer crowds. The lakes were frozen (not fully, but a good amount), and there were consistent patches of snow at the top of the mountain at [Bear Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/bear-lake-nature-trail--3 "buzz"), which is one of the more popular trails at the Rockies. We were originally planning to head all the way up to [Emerald Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/emerald-lake-trail "buzz"), but the posted park ranger had informed us that spikes were required this time of year to navigate the higher-altitude trails.

The trail around Bear Lake was *super slippery* from the ice, and my worn down Ultraboosts had literally zero grip on the ice so I was slipping and sliding everywhere. From the pictures, it seems like the weather would be freezing, but it was honestly not that cold despite the snow and ice. A hoodie and sweatpants easily got me through the day.

As the trail was quite short, we drove to another trail that I hadn't gone to before: [Bierstadt Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/bierstadt-lake-loop-trail "buzz"). At first glance, I feel like this was one of those trails that many people overlook and is not as well known. The trailhead is just on the side of the road with a super small parking lot attached. This trail itself is nothing too special, just your typical, moderately difficult hike with great mountain views behind you as you hike up. However, once you get to the top, Bierstadt Lake itself is something special. 

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/rocky-mtn-6.webp "size=xxl")

Maybe it was the time of the year and there were only 1-2 groups hiking, but I can confidently say being at that lake was one of the quietest, most serene experiences I've had. You could not hear a single thing, yet at the same time, from a single leaf rustling to the crunch of your footstep against the dirt, you could hear everything so clearly in that moment.

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/rocky-mtn-7.webp "size=s") ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/rocky-mtn-8.webp "size=m")

We faced beautiful mountain scenery hiking back down the mountain, and driving back at sunset with orange-pink sun rays outlining mountain ranges was awe-inspiring, to say the least. Before driving back to Boulder, we decided to stop at Estes Park to walk around and explore the shops, grab some famous [Colorado Cherry Company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U4U9UAzBFuxXzyCB6 "buzz") at the Stanley Hotel, which just happens to be a haunted hotel that inspired Stephen King's *The Shining*. Personally, I could **not** imagine purposefully (or unpurposefully) staying a night at a hotel, but I guess others find that thrilling. Apparently, Room 217 (the haunted room in the movie) is super expensive to stay in. We grabbed some real cool local wine at a [local winery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8K29Ur57aSTLbWsF8 "buzz") before driving back (the label itself was cool, and the "sweet notes" were what we were looking for). I'm not a wine connoisseur, but this wine definitely tasted different (and better!) than some of the $4 bottles I've bought at Trader Joe's.

## Day 4
We spent our final day in downtown Denver before heading back home to Texas at night. Honestly, there's not too much to say about downtown Denver. I feel like the city itself is relatively uneventful in terms of sight-seeing, and some parts are nicer than others. For example, we thought [16th Street Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N5gvRjCA7MXs8a586 "buzz") would be a lot more interesting and vibey than it actually was, and I wouldn't recommend it to others visiting. We did end up seeing [Union Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1GiChKswj81PfbtB8 "buzz"), which had this beautiful, festive interior ahead of the holidays. 

\center ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/denver-1.webp "size=s") ![Picture](/assets/blog/travel/colorado/denver-2.webp "size=s")

We walked all the way across the river to the REI and the shopping area nearby, which was a lot nicer and reminded me of a small Mueller in Austin. Before heading to the airport, we grabbed some thai food at [Liang's Thai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eZ8KyEkQZPVSavQG8 "buzz"), which was some *really solid, bang-for-your-buck* Thai food that I would highly recommend if you're every in the downtown area. If you do visit, make sure to bring cash.

## Thoughts

Overall, I *really* enjoyed Boulder. I honestly wouldn't have wished for it to be significantly longer or shorter. Boulder is the perfect amount of stuff to do for a long weekend, even if you're flying from out of town. I think the only thing we wanted to see and missed was the [Boulder Dushanbe Teahouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7wmaK2xaeoP9hxrv7 "buzz") and a hot springs (none were near Boulder). It's got the perfect mix of nature-y things to do, great food, and random sights to see without having to drive too many hours. Having the perfect amount of planned activities (ie. Chautauqua Park, Cozobi Fonda Fina) and random spontaneous events (ie. Bierstadt Lake, Snow Peaks Winery, random coffee shops) reminded me of how much I enjoy this style of traveling, where there's not too much stress on seeing *everything* and having the *most optimized* trip. It might be a while before I come back to Boulder specifically, but I'm sure I'll see myself back in Colorado in a year or two hoping to hit the slopes next time ⛷🏼!
