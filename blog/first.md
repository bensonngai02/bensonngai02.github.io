Welcome to the very beginning of hopefully many new writings and posts to come in 2026 and beyond!

To start, let's begin with why I've created this "blog". I can't remember the last time I did any form of writing that was not academic or work related. However, as 2025 comes to a close, and every app on this planet is now doing some version of Spotify Wrapped, going through these "wrappeds" has actually reminded me of many experiences that have slowly slipped away to the depths of my mind (for instance, Beli Wrapped reminded me of a few mindblowing restaurants that I forgot I even went to earlier this year). 

This easily extends beyond restaurants and music - to generally what I've done in 2025. When scrolling through my camera roll, I see that I've already taken thousands of pictures this year alone from countless exciting events and adventures from when I was in my last semester of college in the first half of the year, to my post-college summer, to beginning my first full time job in the second half of 2025.

As a fairly forgetful person, I find myself easily mixing up "when what happened". As such, I'm hoping that documenting stuff down on an occasional basis on this "blog" will be a great way of solidifying some of these memories down beyond pictures in a camera roll. 

Some of the stuff I'm hoping to add to this blog, off the top of my head, are:
- **Travels**. I love going to new places, and this year I found myself going to so many national parks and places with so many pictures I'd like to share without making entire instagram posts for them. 
- **Restaurants**. Though I've started using Beli to document restaurants I've tried and new ones on my to-go list, I'm not *the* biggest fan of Beli's rating system. I'm never really a hater, so many of my restaurants end up in the "I liked it" or "It was fine" categories, inflating a bunch of my scores. Though I don't think I've truly visited a 10.0 restaurant just yet, my Beli rating list says otherwise. One of my goals is to document (especially particularly memorable) food experiences here with reviews beyond just a numerical 0-10 score and single-line-caption pictures, and hopefully create a rating list of my own.
- **Cooking**. Those who know me know I love to cook. More times than not do I actually find myself enjoying the cooking more than the eating (I just feel full after cooking). I'd like to start posting some of the food I make. 
- **Technical Notes**. I love learning about stuff related to CS and math all the time (related and unrelated to work), but these things are so easily forgettable and I have to relearn it again when not noted down somewhere.

Almost all of these posts will be short and informal, so I'm encouraged to get into the habit of updating this on a fairly occasional basis. Hopefully, this can become a place that not only allows me to document and revisit experiences and adventures for myself, but also share it to those who are interested in me or my passions.
