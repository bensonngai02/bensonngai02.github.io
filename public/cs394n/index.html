<p>
I'm an undergraduate senior studying CS (Turing Scholars Honors) + Math. Last summer, I was a SWE intern at Bloomberg. 
In terms of research, I've previously worked on generative AI in computational biology / drug discovery, and in the past year
have focused more on computer vision & geometry-based AI in Dr. Qixing Huang's Graphics/AI lab. I was working on 
experimenting and improving results for a 3D broken object reconstruction problem.

<p>
Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

<p>
(1) Computer Vision / Geometry Processing

<p>
(2) Computational Biology / Drug Discovery

<p>
(3) Computational Neuroscience (not much experience, but very interested!)

<p>
I have teamed up with Brian Kim.
