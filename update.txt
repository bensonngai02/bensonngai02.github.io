Look at this entire repository. I have a few problems with it:
    1. The code style is wayyy too old, it uses straight HTML and CSS which is honestly fine, but updating my website with 
    new things such as new blog posts, new experiences, is just a hassle. It's not very modular. You can decide whether to keep
    using straight HTML/CSS or something better, but I just want a more modern code stack that is easy to easily update.
    2. This setup does NOT work with Phone screens; it just displays as a regular webpage. 
    3. I need a way to easily upload new blog / writing posts. Provide me a way of easily updating blog posts.
    4. I no longer want the experiences / projects to be in these chunky blocks. Look at this website for inspiration for experiences/websites: https://www.rashadphz.com
    5. The actual flow of my website (bio, experiences, project, life) is fine. Keep that.
